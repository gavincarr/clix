- the colours version:
  o distinguish between IM and MB type accounts, and colour differently
    x base colours: IM (magenta), MB, (green) MB reply (red), MB yours (white)
  o for MB accounts, highlight @usernames (yellow) and #hashtags (magenta) and $symbols (magenta)
  o highlight URLs
  o colour your MBs differently
  o colour replies to you differently
  o make colours customisable
- make a POE command line version, allowing sending
- make mapping cleverer, including regexes
- allow jids to filter (include) on the command line e.g. clix twitter@twitter.com zomojo.com 
- add exclude option, to invert previous (clix -X twitter.com)
