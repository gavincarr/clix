- the colours version:
  o distinguish between IM and MB type accounts, and colour differently
  o for MB accounts, highlight @usernames and #hashtags and $symbols
  o highlight URLs
  o colour your MBs differently
  o colour replies to you differently
  o make colours customisable
- make a POE command line version, allowing sending
- make mapping cleverer, including regexes
- allow jids to filter (include) on the command line e.g. clix twitter@twitter.com zomojo.com 
- add exclude option, to invert previous (clix -X twitter.com)
